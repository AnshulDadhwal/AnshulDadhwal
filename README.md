### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Anshul Dadhwal, who is currently a Junior student in University of Queensland (UQ) studying Bachelor's of Engineering (Honours) in Software Engineering. I am an extremely passionate individual with a drive to learn new skills every day. I love to write code! I enjoy talking about everything in Technology. 

As a software engineering major, I have recently started out in the world of DevOps and exploring the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. This semester, I am studying Cloud Computing, Probability and Statistics, Programming in the Large and Introduction to Computer Systems.

Besides coding, I spend my free time listening to music and going out on late night walks! Some of my favourite sport based hobbies include football, tennis and cricket.
